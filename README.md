From basic to advanced: test how well you know JavaScript, refresh your knowledge a bit, or prepare for your coding interview! :muscle: :rocket: I update this repo regularly with new questions. I added the answers in the **collapsed sections** below the questions, simply click on them to expand it. It's just for fun, good luck! :heart:</span>

###### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {

- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

###### 2. What's the output?

```javascript

let user = { name: 'John' };
var admin = { name: 'Admin' };

function sayHi() {
    console.log(this.name);
}

user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;
user.f();
admin.f();
admin['f]();

```

- A: `John` `Admin` `undefined`
- B: `John` `Admin` `SyntaxError`
- C: `John` `Admin` `Admin`
- D: `John` `undefined` `undefined`
