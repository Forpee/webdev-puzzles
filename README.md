<span>I post multiple choice JavaScript questions on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theavocoder) **stories**, which I'll also post here! Last updated: <a href=#20200612><b>June 12th</b></a>

From basic to advanced: test how well you know JavaScript, refresh your knowledge a bit, or prepare for your coding interview! :muscle: :rocket: I update this repo regularly with new questions. I added the answers in the **collapsed sections** below the questions, simply click on them to expand it. It's just for fun, good luck! :heart:</span>

Feel free to reach out to me! 😊 <br />

| Feel free to use them in a project! 😃  I would _really_ appreciate a reference to this repo, I create the questions and explanations (yes I'm sad lol) and the community helps me so much to maintain and improve it! 💪🏼 Thank you and have fun!   |
